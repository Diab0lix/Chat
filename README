# Python chat

## Set up

To run the server, run:

    > python3 udp_server.py

The default port is 8888. You can manually specify another port by appending it to the command, like so:

    > python3 udp_server.py 1234

You can then launch the client on the same port (default 8888, custom same as above)

    > python3 udp_client.py [1234]

## Commands

First of all, set you username with the /pseudo <username> command.
The server will send a reply to notify you if the command has been a success.

After this, you can join the list of available people by sending /join.
To consult the list of people available to chat, type /clients.
